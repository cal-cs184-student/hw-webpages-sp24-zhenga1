The cloth is also very unperturbed in the steady state(i.e. Less wrinkled). For low damping, the cloth looks very wrinkled, and the cloth oscillates many times across the vertical steady state position before reaching its steady state position, as the kinetic energy takes a while to dissipate(as it finishes falling). The finished state is also much more wrinkled, as the cloth is much more perturbed.</p>

It gets to the resting position in the most straightfoward way. </p>

        We can see that the bigger the spring constant, the less “draped”, i.e. vertical the cloth appears to be. With the case where ks=5000, the cloth is almost entirely vertically draped on the sides of the ball, whereas for ks = 50000 the cloth is basically somewhat hovering, rather than completely horizontal. The reason for this is that gravity is pulling the cloth downwards as it hangs over the ball, thereby stretching the cloth. However, the spring force resists stretching and perturbations in the cloth’s shape. As Ks increases, the spring force is stronger, so the cloth resists perturbations by gravity, and thus does not tend to drape completely vertically over the ball. Similarly, the opposite can be said for when Ks decreases, leading to the results seen.

        <li class="question">Vary the <code>density</code> as well as <code>ks</code> and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        We see that, the more dense the cloth is, the more the cloth tends to resist going towards a more flat and smooth surface shape, and tends to stay bent and sheared. In other words, the denser the cloth, it appears the more viscous the cloth is, as it would fold and perturb against itself rather than fall flat and smooth (can be seen from the images). I argue that this is because, although the flatter and smoother shape is more stable, for a greater density object, it requires a greater amount of spring force per unit area to be able to smoothen the shape. But, if the spring constants are the same, the spring force of the cloth may not be enough to force the cloth into a smoother shape. This is why the cloth remains in an unsmooth and unstable state for higher density, and is very smooth when density of the cloth is low.
        <br />
        <br />
        For higher spring constants Ks, we see that the spring forces per unit area of the cloth is increased without changing the density. So, based on previous explanations, we should expect the spring constant to have an opposite effect compared to the density of the cloth, where a higher spring constant leads to a more smooth cloth, and vice versa. This is indeed what is observed. So we argue that a higher spring constant increases smoothness in the cloth, and the opposite is true for density of the cloth.

    <ul>
        <li class="question">Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        A shader program is basically a program that, for a given set of inputs, takes in various parameters of a vertex (such as its normal, its position and tangent), and returns a color that describes the color that the vertex should be rendered with. When a shader is selected, every single pixel vertex and their parameters are passed into the selected shader, and the resulting image is rendered from the result of this shader program at every pixel. By customizing the shader program, we can achieve various desired types of appearances that the scene will resemble. For example, Blin Phong Shading will make the scene bright, while also including aspects of spectral shading, making the ray direction that is closest to the reflected direction (of the light ray) very bright. Toon shading will make the scene look very simplistic and like it came from a cartoon.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vertex shading takes in a vertex position and applies a transformation in the position of the relevant vertex variables like normal and position before passing the result into the fragment shader. It can act as a preprocessing unit, while the fragment shader is the main processing unit that does the returning of the color.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fragment shading takes in relevant vertex variables like position and normal obtained from the vertex shader and calculates the resulting color of that specific pixel that was originally passed into the vector shader. Usually fragment shaders take in one pixel to be processed, which may not be the original pixel passed into the vertex shader but a transformed version.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li class="question">Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        Blinn-Phong shading is a comprehensive form of shading that includes ambience shading, diffuse shading, and specular shading. Ambience shading guarantees that the scene will be always partially lit everywhere, whereas diffuse shading will ensure that properly lit up areas of the scene are brighter than dimly lit areas, regardless of the direction of sight, as light rays that arrive at those points will sometimes scatter, brightening those points regardless of viewing direction.
        <br />
        <br />
        Specular shading guarantees that certain viewing angles that are very close to the angle of reflection of the light will be brighter, which makes sense as light will more likely travel along the angle of reflection than other angles.
        <br />
        <br />
        Put together, the Blinn Phong shading is a computationally cheap way to render a scene realistically, taking into account ambient, diffuse and specular lighting.

        We see that, for bump mapping, the rendering looks a lot more mildly perturbed based on the shape of the texture, as it looks like the positions of the vertices has not been altered much, whereas for the case of displacement mapping, the rendering is a lot more perturbed based on the shape of the texture.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a simple consequence of the definition of the two renderings. The bump mapping procedure only changes the vertex normals and does not change the actual positions of the vertices, thus only giving the illusion of a perturbation in the cloth fabric. This illusion is caused by varied brightness of vertices on the cloth fabric, not that the actual positions of the vertices are changed. However, for displacement mapping, this situation is completely different… the actual positions of the vertices are changed as v_position is changed, the consequence of this is that the final result looks much more perturbed than the case of the bump mapping.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, we see that for both the bump and displacement case, the oa parameters control the granularity of the noise and information being applied to the rendering. The higher oa parameters leads to the image looking more fine and less noisy, and the lower oa parameters leads to the opposite. We see this somewhat clearly for the bump case as the right image is slightly more detailed, although this effect is not incredibly apparent. For the case of the displacement, the effect is very pronounced, as the more coarse image has much more flat surfaces, but the less coarse image is much more pronounced, where the vertices are much more (spiky), which indicates that the texture mapping is being sampled at a denser rate, unlike the more coarse image for which the displacement seems as if it is an averaged over the texture mapping.

        <h3>1. Toon Shading</h3>
        In Toon Shading, we made a shader that made the scene look like it is from a cartoon. The way we did it is by discretizing the color that is returned based on the intensity of the light intensity that arrived at the point. This way, we make the transitions in brightness discontinuous, making the rendered image look hand drawn.

    <p>First, I want the cloth to show different color when I rotate the camera view. To do that, in texture sampling (a rainbow texture), I included camera direction in the input v_uv, which means rotating camera changes the uv input that I sample with.
        Then, the cloth is now a smooth rainbow cloth whose color shifts when I rotate the camera. To add some grainy and wavy effect, I used a texture map called Perlin noise which alters the normal. In addition to camera direction, the v_uv input to the sample texture is also dependent on the altered normal. 
        The perlin noise texture is found here. https://medium.com/@sunnless/iridescent-shader-breakdown-c87ec5fe1e2a
